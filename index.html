        <p>There are more self-employed workers in London than ever. Some of us can't afford to pay for office spaces, and don't want to stay cooped up at home all day. Free work spaces aren't that obvious to find, they come in all shapes and sizes. Freelancers, students and self-employed home workers need places to work away from the house with a wifi connection, desks, chairs, and ideally a bit of peace. This site was built with a view to helping people find places to they can bring their laptop and work without having to pay rent. If you have any recommendations, please get in touch.

            <span class="description"><p>The Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall is a grand and impressive space. Set right on the river, and just a few minutes walk form Waterloo station, it offers some inspiring views for you to take in from over your laptop. There are several levels of foyers that anyone can come and use for free, whether its meeting with colleagues, or studying solo. Most foyers are furnished with sofas / comfy chairs and / or tables and chairs for you to work at, and there is no pressure to buy anything. The only downside is there aren’t so many power sockets, so make sure you charge your laptop to be safe! I found some on the balcony overlooking the ground floor bar, and on one of the middle floor foyers. You just need to arrive early to make sure you get the best spot. </p>

              <span class="description"><p>Located on the south bank of the Thames, the Reubens Library is a perfect location to work if you want 		beautiful riverside views to step out onto for a break / meeting / lunch, and there are countless bars, restaurants, cafes and 			stalls within right on the doorstep. The library is located within the British Film Institute (BFI) building and is free to use, 		and has great wifi, and best of all, a very peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Perfect for anyone who really needs to get their head 		down and concentrate. One half of the library is free for anyone to use, the other half hosts a wealth of work spaces with power 		sockets galore dedicated for members only (it takes 30 seconds to sign up).

            <span class="description">
              <p>Just minutes from the silicon roundabout, Google Campus Cafe draws hundreds of self-employed / self-studying types and developers every weekday. The space is completely free for anyone to use once they have signed up, which takes just one minute. The free workspace is in the lower-ground floor, which is well lit, and holds an outdoor space for lunch breaks, phone-calls and al-fresco workers. In my experience, the demographic leans heavily towards tech / web developers, so if you are working or studying in software / web, you will meet plenty of like-minded people. There is a strong agenda for networking there too, and they often hold bespoke events for developers and start-ups; from hackathons to investor meet and greets. There are also another 6 or so floors with dedicated paid-for spaces and meeting rooms if things start to really take off for you.

            <span class="description"><p>The National Arts Library is up there amongst some of the most stunning and inspiring locations to work. The library is located within the Victoria & Albert Museum, on the first floor. The tall walls are stacked with old leather-bound reference books, the desks are very old fashioned wooden designs, but most of them are modified with power sockets. The library’s huge windows look down on the V&A museums stunning courtyard. There is a wealth of cultural reference materials, magazines and other publications, also the library is subscribed to a number of paid-subscription publications, which you can access for free from the library’s computers. Otherwise if you just want to do your own thing, there is a free wifi network accessible throughout the library. Worth noting its a reference library, as such, its very quiet, and not suitable for meetings or work/study-groups. Another perk is you are about a 10 minute stroll from Hyde Park, which makes a great location for an al fresco lunch break.</p>

            <p><strong>Etiquette: </strong>In order to access the free wifi, you need to sign up to Southwark Libraries, which may require presenting some form of ID with proof of address (you don’t need to be a resident of the borough of Southwark however). Other than that, for a library, there doesn’t seem to be much of a noise restriction.</p>

            <span class="description"><p>The John Harvard Library is a community library based on Borough High Street. Towards the back of the library is an area of work booths for those who want to really get their head down. Otherwise if you want to work in a group or hold a meeting, there is a nice Cafe at the front of the library on your left as you enter. Being a community library, you do get schools visiting, which can get noisy to say the least, so if you are sensitive to distraction, you may be better off up the road at the Reuben BFI, which is much quieter. Its worth noting also that once you're a member of Southwark Libraries, you can use your membership card to access the internet in any library within Southwark, including Peckham Library</p>

            <span class="description"><p>The Barbican is a bustling cultural hub, with a focus on arts and culture. Its a great place for anyone to work, whether you’re working quietly on your own in the library, or meeting / working in a group, which is possible in any one of the many lobbies and foyers around the building. There’s a strong free wifi signal throughout the building, and loads of seats. You’ll have more luck finding a power socket in the library, but there are chairs and tables all over the building. You may find the foyers often fill up with concert-goers, especially in the evenings, but if you want to work in peace, the library is your best bet. One great perk is the vast outdoor space in the centre of the Barbican Centre which is a great place to sit and have lunch looking across the huge water feature. </p>

            <span class="description"><p>Anyone can use the hallways and lobbies of the Tate Modern for free without obligation, and there’s free wifi throughout the building. Space is fairly limited and basic (bench spaces, and little-to-no power sockets). For any Tate members however, the new Tate member’s room on the 8th floor of the new Switch House extension is a great place to work. The space is reasonably quiet all throughout the day, there are power sockets and all manner of desks / tables, chairs and arm chairs to choose from. The view is worth a mention 8 floors up you get to see London and the Thames from a pretty unique perspective. Admittedly this is not any entirely free workspace, as you need to pay for membership <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/join-support/tate-members">(details here)</a>, however, for the price: not only getting access to the members rooms, but access also to every exhibition at any one of their four galleries, if you can afford it, its well worth it.</p>
